# SREERAM'S SIMPLE KEYLOGGER (Educational Use Only)

This is a basic keylogger written in Python using the `pynput` library. It captures keystrokes from the keyboard and logs them to a local text file along with timestamps.

- Runs for a user-defined duration (in seconds)
- Stores output in a plain text file (`key_log.txt`)
